I recently completed a Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on Diwali sales analysis, and I'm thrilled to share a summary of my findings with you! 📊💡
🔍 Project Overview: In this EDA project, I delved into a comprehensive dataset to uncover valuable insights about Diwali sales. The primary objective was to gain a deeper understanding of sales patterns, customer behavior, and key factors influencing sales during the festive season.
🏬 Data Collection: I collected a robust dataset comprising sales data from various retail stores, e-commerce platforms, and consumer surveys. The dataset encompassed information about products, prices, discounts, customer demographics, and purchase history.
🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis: With the dataset in hand, I embarked on a journey to explore the intricacies of Diwali sales. Here are the key steps and techniques I employed during the analysis:
1️⃣ Data Cleaning and Pre-processing: I meticulously cleaned and pre-processed the dataset, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step was essential to ensure data quality and integrity.
2️⃣ Sales Trend Analysis: I analysed the historical sales data over multiple Diwali seasons to identify recurring trends, such as peak sales periods, popular product categories, and customer spending patterns. This analysis provided valuable insights into the dynamics of Diwali sales.
3️⃣ Customer Segmentation: Using clustering algorithms and demographic data, I segmented customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and preferences. This segmentation shed light on different customer segments' preferences, allowing businesses to tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.
🔮 Key Findings: After an extensive exploration of the data, I discovered several noteworthy findings:

•	most of the buyers are females and even the purchasing power of females are greater than men.
•	most of the buyers are of age group between 26-35 yrs female.
